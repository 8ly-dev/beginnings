## Prerequisites from Phase 0
- ✅ Project structure established with uv package management
- ✅ Testing framework (pytest) configured and functional
- ✅ Code quality tools (ruff, mypy, bandit) operational
- ✅ Virtual environment with core dependencies installed
- ✅ AI agent directives and best practices documented

## Phase 1 Detailed Architecture Goals

### Public Interface Specifications

#### App Class Public Interface
The main application class that developers interact with:
```python
class App(FastAPI):
    def __init__(self, config_dir: Optional[str] = None, environment: Optional[str] = None)
    def create_html_router(**router_kwargs) -> HTMLRouter
    def create_api_router(**router_kwargs) -> APIRouter
    def get_config() -> Dict[str, Any]
    def get_extension(extension_name: str) -> Optional[BaseExtension]
```

**App Class Behavior**:
- Extends FastAPI with configuration-driven enhancements
- Automatically loads configuration on initialization
- Provides factory methods for creating configured routers
- Manages extension lifecycle (startup/shutdown)
- Exposes configuration and loaded extensions to application code

#### HTMLRouter Public Interface
Router for browser-facing pages with HTML responses:
```python
class HTMLRouter(APIRouter):
    def __init__(self, config_loader: ConfigLoader, **fastapi_kwargs)
    # Standard FastAPI router methods enhanced with configuration:
    def get(path: str, **kwargs) -> Callable
    def post(path: str, **kwargs) -> Callable
    def put(path: str, **kwargs) -> Callable
    def delete(path: str, **kwargs) -> Callable
    # Plus all other FastAPI APIRouter methods
```

**HTMLRouter Behavior**:
- Automatically applies HTMLResponse as default response class
- Applies route configuration and middleware chains to all registered routes
- Integrates with template engines for rendering
- Supports static file serving configuration
- Handles browser-specific features (cookies, redirects, forms)

#### APIRouter Public Interface
Router for machine-to-machine JSON APIs:
```python
class APIRouter(APIRouter):
    def __init__(self, config_loader: ConfigLoader, **fastapi_kwargs)
    # Standard FastAPI router methods enhanced with configuration:
    def get(path: str, **kwargs) -> Callable
    def post(path: str, **kwargs) -> Callable
    def put(path: str, **kwargs) -> Callable
    def delete(path: str, **kwargs) -> Callable
    # Plus all other FastAPI APIRouter methods
```

**APIRouter Behavior**:
- Automatically applies JSONResponse as default response class
- Applies route configuration and middleware chains to all registered routes
- Integrates with OpenAPI documentation generation
- Handles CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Optimized for programmatic access patterns

#### BaseExtension Public Interface
Abstract base class that all extensions must inherit from:
```python
class BaseExtension(ABC):
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> None
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_middleware_factory(self) -> Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], Callable]
    
    @abstractmethod
    def should_apply_to_route(self, path: str, methods: List[str], route_config: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool
    
    def get_startup_handler(self) -> Optional[Callable[[], Awaitable[None]]]
    def get_shutdown_handler(self) -> Optional[Callable[[], Awaitable[None]]]
    def validate_config(self) -> List[str]
```

**BaseExtension Behavior Contract**:
- Extensions receive their configuration section during initialization
- Middleware factory creates route-specific middleware from route configuration
- Route applicability determines which routes the extension affects
- Startup/shutdown handlers manage extension lifecycle
- Config validation returns list of error messages (empty if valid)

### Complex Internal System Specifications

#### Configuration Include System
**System Purpose**: Allow configuration to be split across multiple files while maintaining single source of truth and preventing conflicts.

**Include Processing Behavior**:
1. Base configuration file contains `include:` directive with list of relative file paths
2. Each included file is loaded and validated as standalone YAML
3. All included configurations are merged into base using `dict.update()` semantics
4. If any top-level key appears in multiple files, system fails immediately at startup
5. Include paths are restricted to configuration directory (no path traversal)
6. Circular includes are detected and cause startup failure
7. Missing included files cause startup failure with clear error message

**Conflict Detection Logic**:
- Before merging, collect all top-level keys from base and all included files
- If any key appears in multiple sources, generate error showing which files conflict
- Error message format: "Key 'auth' found in both config/app.yaml and config/auth.yaml"
- This prevents accidental configuration overwrites and ensures intentional organization

#### Route Configuration Resolution System
**System Purpose**: Determine what configuration applies to a specific route based on patterns, exact matches, and method specificity.

**Resolution Algorithm Behavior**:
1. Start with empty configuration dictionary
2. Apply global defaults if they exist
3. Find all pattern matches for the route path, sorted by specificity (most specific first)
4. Apply each matching pattern's configuration in specificity order
5. Apply exact path configuration if it exists (highest priority)
6. Apply method-specific configuration for the HTTP method if it exists (highest priority)
7. Cache the resolved configuration for future requests to same route

**Pattern Matching Logic**:
- Exact paths (no wildcards) have highest specificity
- Patterns with more literal characters are more specific than those with fewer
- Wildcard patterns (`*`) match any path segment
- Examples: `/admin/users` > `/admin/*` > `/*` > global defaults

**Configuration Inheritance**:
- Later configurations override earlier ones using dict.update() semantics
- No deep merging - if a section is overridden, entire section is replaced
- Method-specific config only applies to matching HTTP methods
- Resolved configuration includes all applicable settings for the route

#### Extension Loading and Middleware Chain System
**System Purpose**: Dynamically load extensions and build middleware chains for routes based on configuration.

**Extension Loading Behavior**:
1. Parse extension specifications from configuration (`module.path:ClassName` format)
2. Dynamically import specified module using importlib
3. Instantiate extension class with its configuration section
4. Validate extension implements BaseExtension interface
5. Register extension for middleware chain building
6. Call startup handlers during application startup
7. Call shutdown handlers during application shutdown

**Middleware Chain Building Behavior**:
1. When route is registered, resolve its configuration
2. Query all loaded extensions to see which apply to the route
3. For applicable extensions, call their middleware factory with route configuration
4. Order middleware according to extension loading order (configurable in future)
5. Compose middleware functions into a chain using function wrapping
6. Apply the middleware chain to the route handler
7. Register the enhanced route handler with FastAPI

**Middleware Execution Flow**:
- Middleware executes in LIFO order (last registered runs first)
- Each middleware receives request and a "call_next" function
- Middleware can process request before calling next middleware
- Middleware can process response after next middleware returns
- Exceptions in middleware are handled and can be caught by outer middleware
- If middleware doesn't call next, request processing stops at that middleware

#### Environment Detection and Override System
**System Purpose**: Automatically detect environment and load appropriate configuration overrides.

**Environment Detection Logic**:
1. Check `BEGINNINGS_DEV_MODE` environment variable first
   - If "true", "1", or "yes" (case insensitive), force development environment
2. Check `BEGINNINGS_ENV` environment variable second
   - Use exact value specified (dev, staging, production, custom names)
3. Default to "production" if no environment variables set
4. Normalize common variations (development -> dev, stage -> staging)

**Configuration File Resolution**:
- Production environment: use `app.yaml` (clean, no environment suffix)
- Other environments: try `app.{environment}.yaml`, fallback to `app.yaml` if missing
- Custom config directory via `BEGINNINGS_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable
- All include directives processed relative to the resolved configuration directory

**Override Application**:
- Environment-specific files completely replace base configuration
- Include directives in environment files processed independently
- Environment variable interpolation applied after all files merged
- Configuration validation applied to final merged result
