- Debouncing for rapid successive file changes
- Smart filtering to ignore temporary files and editor artifacts

**Reload Decision Logic**:
```python
class ReloadDecisionEngine:
    def should_reload_for_change(self, file_path: str, event_type: str) -> ReloadType:
        """Determine reload type based on file change"""
        if file_path.endswith('.py'):
            if self._is_core_file(file_path):
                return ReloadType.FULL_RESTART
            elif self._is_extension_file(file_path):
                return ReloadType.EXTENSION_RELOAD
            else:
                return ReloadType.APPLICATION_RELOAD
        
        elif file_path.endswith(('.yaml', '.yml')):
            if self._is_config_file(file_path):
                return ReloadType.CONFIG_RELOAD
        
        elif file_path.endswith(('.html', '.jinja2')):
            return ReloadType.TEMPLATE_CACHE_CLEAR
        
        elif file_path.startswith('static/'):
            return ReloadType.STATIC_CACHE_CLEAR
        
        return ReloadType.NO_RELOAD
```
